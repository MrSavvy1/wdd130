            Contribution: Galileo Galilei is celebrated for his pioneering work with telescopes and the advancement of observational astronomy. He made significant contributions to the Copernican revolution. 
            Discoveries: Galileo's observations using telescopes led to groundbreaking discoveries. He observed the four largest moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons), sunspots on the Sun, the phases of Venus, and the irregular surface of the Moon, all of which challenged the geocentric model and supported the heliocentric view.

          <img class = "heros" src ="images/Copernicus.jpeg" alt ="Copernicus"> <div><h5> Nicolaus Copernicus 
          (1476-1543)</h5>
            <p class = "page">
              Contribution: Nicolaus Copernicus is often called the father of modern astronomy. He introduced the heliocentric model of the solar system, where he proposed that the Sun is at the center and that Earth and other planets orbit around it. This revolutionary idea challenged the geocentric model, which had been dominant for centuries. 
              Discoveries: Copernicus' most significant discovery was the realization that the planets, including Earth, move in elliptical orbits around the Sun. This foundational work laid the groundwork for the later scientific revolution.

            <p class = "page">
              
              Contribution: Johannes Kepler made remarkable contributions to our understanding of planetary motion. He formulated Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion, which describe the orbital paths of planets in our solar system. 
              Discoveries: Kepler's first law describes the elliptical shape of planetary orbits. His second law, the law of equal areas, relates the speed of a planet in its orbit. The third law, the law of harmonics, connects the orbital periods and distances of planets.

            <p class = "page">
              
              Contribution: Sir Isaac Newton is a giant in the history of science. He laid the foundation for classical physics and mechanics, making significant contributions to our understanding of the laws of motion and universal gravitation. 
              Discoveries: Newton's three laws of motion, known as Newton's Laws, provided the framework for understanding how objects move. His law of universal gravitation explained how objects are attracted to each other due to their mass and distance.

          </h5>
            <p class = "page">
             
            Contribution: Edwin Hubble played a pivotal role in modern cosmology. He discovered the expansion of the universe, providing crucial evidence for the Big Bang theory. 
            Discoveries: Hubble observed that galaxies are moving away from each other, and the farther a galaxy is, the faster it recedes. This led to Hubble's law and the realization that the universe is expanding, providing the basis for our modern understanding of cosmology.

              Did you know? Earth's Early Years:
              In the early stages, Earth was a hostile environment with volcanic activity and constant meteorite impacts. Over time, the surface cooled, and the first oceans began to take shape.

              Did you know? Earth's Changing Climate:
              Earth's climate has changed dramatically over time. From ice ages to warm periods, our planet has experienced a range of environmental conditions that shaped the evolution of species.

              Did you know? The Vast Universe:
              The universe, containing billions of galaxies, is vast and ever-expanding. Each galaxy, like our Milky Way, hosts billions of stars, and many may have planets orbiting them.
          
              Did you know? Earth's Fiery Birth:
              Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from the dust and gas surrounding the young Sun. Intense heat and collisions led to the molten mass we now call our planet.
