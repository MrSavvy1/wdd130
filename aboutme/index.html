        <p style = "margin:0px;" id = "leo">  I am fondly called Mr Savvy as a cut for my name, although my friends like to play around with me, I love a quiet time for myself. I love thinking about alot of possibilities and thats one of the reason I choose to study web development. My degree path is software development.
        </p>
        <p> I love watching sci-fi movies, I am a foodie, I love food, I love being curious about how things are and why they are the way they are. I am not married yet, still single and searching for a soulmate, although I am currently unemployed, I am on a lookout for available jobs to fit in. I love BYU because of the real world stimulation learning curriculum it adopts and I am pursuing a AA kind of degree.</p>
        <p> I know that web design will be the future, the most sort skill in no time to come, thats one of the advantages I hold on to studying this course. I have been a member of the church for 2years now and I love every thing about it</p>
